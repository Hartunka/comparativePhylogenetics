# comparativePhylogenetics
Code used for experiments described in my Master's thesis

The main files are main-full.R and main-families.R. They were used to run the stan models.
The directory dataprep contains the code used to prepare the data for the models.
The directoy fit.R contains the fit.R script containing functions used for fitting the models (also used to contain .Rmd scripts used to compare model variants when deciding for specific model architecture).
The directory models contains the stancode for the models used (and also some old model variants not eventually used).
The directory posterior contains code to read and plot the evaluation results.
The directory test only contains code snippets to test the indexes for some operations are assigned properly.
